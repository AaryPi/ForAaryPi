                <p class="message">Happy Valentine's Day Aary. Sometimes the most special things are the ones we dont communicate by voice, but the ones we write down. The ones we always have because they will always be there for us to see. You are perfect Aary. We have been through so much together, but no matter what, you are on my mind day in and day out. I am so proud of you and all you have accomplished. In just the past few weeks you have landed a lab position, got a job, and continue to do incredible in your classes no matter how much is going on in your life. You are the strongest person I know. You just have this ability to get through anything no matter what life throws at you and I really admire that. Keep being the strong, incredible, driven, passionate, and beautiful girl you have always been. I love you forever and always my aary.</p>
